To shed light on the complexity of neurobiological phenomena we use simplified mathematical models that capture core mechanistic features of the circuit and connect them to its computational goals. We use techniques from dynamical systems, statistical physics, machine learning and information theory. A second line of interest is development of new statistical and computational tools for analyzing large, high-dimensional neural and behavioral datasets.

Current projects include the assessment of fatigue fracture mechanisms and tribological performance of orthopedic biomaterials, as well as characterization of orthopedic tissues and associated devices. Surface modifications using plasma chemistry are used to optimize polymers for medical applications. Attention is focused on wear, fatigue and multiaxial loading. Retrievals of orthopedic implants are characterized to model in vivo degradation and physiological loading. Biomechanical characterization of structural tissues is performed to assess clinical treatments and to develop constitutive relationships. Laboratory techniques for structural characterization include SEM, TEM, FEM, SAXS, USAXS, XPS, DSC, GPC, FTIR, AFM, confocal microscopy, wear testing, fatigue testing, fracture mechanics analysis, and nanoindentation.
